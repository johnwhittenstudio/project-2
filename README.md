Contents include the following html page:
* index.html
 
The html web form does not need a server to run and can be completed and interacted with by clicking on the "click here" button.
 
This html web form works on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
 
There are 5 categories in this form:
1. "What is your name?"
2. "What is your age?"
3. "Which animal is the best?"
4. "Which activity brings you the most comfort?"
5. "What is your favorite color?"

After completing the form, the user needs to click on the "click here" button to be taken to the programming language branch. Depending on which selection the user makes in category #3 and category #4, they will be taken to one of 3 different branches.

This html web form site contains 3 branches:
1. "Python"
2. "C#"
3. "Rust"
 
Each branch gives the user an introduction to that specific programming language and contains a hyperlink to the wikipedi page on that language. 

Text entered into the "What is your name?" category will appear at the top of each branch returned. 

Clicking on the "click here" button at the bottom of the programming language branch will redirect the user back to the form, where they can enter different selections.
