There are 5 categories in this form:
1. "What is your name?"
2. "What is your age?"
3. "Which animal is the best?"
4. "Which activity brings you the most comfort?"
5. "What is your favorite color?"

After completing the form, the user needs to click on the "click here" button to be taken to the programming language branch. Depending on which selection the user makes in category #3, they will be taken to a different branch.

This html web form site contains 3 branches:
1. "Python"

3. "Rust"
 
Each branch gives the user an introduction to that specific programming language and contains a hyperlink to the wikipedi page on that language. 

Clicking on the "click here" button at the bottom of the programming language branch will redirect the user back to the form, where they can enter different selections.
